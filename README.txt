The program implements a software system that uses an interactive menu-driven Text-Based User Interface to allow the user to create and manage a list of text lines entered via keyboard or loaded from text files.

To store the text lines, the program uses a database implemented as a class template. The sequence container used for this purpose is std::list.

The purpose of the program is to implement the following in C++:
o	delegate runtime storage management to the Standard Template Library (STL) containers
o	gain experience using the STL sequential containers
o	use iterators to access and manipulate container elements
o	practice text input / output file processing
o	write a C++ class template
